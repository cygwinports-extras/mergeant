ldesc: "Mergeant is a program which helps administer a DBMS database using 
the gnome-db framework (see www.gnome-db.org for more information
about gnome-db). Basically, it memorizes all the structure of the
database, and some queries, and does the SQL queries instead of the user
(not having to type all over again those SQL commands, although it is
still possible to do so)."
