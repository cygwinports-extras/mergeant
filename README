mergeant
------------------------------------------
Mergeant is a program which helps administer a DBMS database using the 
gnome-db framework. Basically, it memorizes all the structure of the 
database, and some queries, and does the SQL queries instead of the user 
(not having to type all over again those SQL commands, although it is 
still possible to do so).
